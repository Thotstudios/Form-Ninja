TODO:
This file is intended to track jobs which have yet to be finished.
This is not official or required in any way.
It's more like quick notes to ourselves and each other.

Chad:
* Unpublished templates should have a 'Resume' button instead of a "Modify" button
* Validate Template before publishing.
* Template Versioning.
* Add autosave for Templates and Forms for crashes/unexpected exits
* Refactor const strings into Constants.h
* Belt icon next to templates (and forms?).
* Add GPS info to signature element.
* Forms and Templates save to PendingUploads folder.
* PendingUploads folder is checked for sync.
* Send regular ipa files.
* Export/email/sync/print button(s) on Form Manager.
* Change hard-coded #defines in TemplateEditor
* Clean up template renaming.
* Clean up section header titles.
* Template Sections need delete function.
* TextFieldAlert should handle rotate and resize.
* Template Creator should be logged-in user's name.
* Deleting templates should reconsider group names.
* Finish Element buttons.
* TextFieldAlert should have delegate return key.
* Check bug with "title" not showing up for TextFieldAlert when addSection called.
* Sanitize template names.
* Give TemplateEditor a path object so it can rename templates and manage the file directory.

Paul:
* Optionally write a TODO list here.

Ron:
* FormElementMultiline:  Validate current length.
* FormElementSingleline: validate current length.
* FormAddressElement:  Validate zip is numerics.
* MainMenu:  The 'slide in/out' effect on rotation looks great, but there are graphical errors when you're moving in from another screen in landscape.  Possible fix:  hide images in viewWillAppear, then animate opacity to fade them in in ViewDidAppear.

Other:
* Localization support
* Change source file creator names (e.g. from Hackenslacker, Programmer, etc)
* Change copyright tags (copyright ThotStudios)
