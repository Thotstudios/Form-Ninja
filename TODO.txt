TODO:
This file is intended to track jobs which have yet to be finished.
This is not official or required in any way.
It's more like quick notes to ourselves and each other.

Chad:
* Update template management view
- include update button
- link duplicate button to something
- should not be able to create a new template if no group (or All Groups) is selected.
* Create form management view
- first, a list of groups including "All Groups"
- second, depending on group selection, is a list of available templates
- third, a template was selected, and user can start filling out form.
- fourth, at any point, user can change to Signature mdoe
* Unpublished templates should have a 'Resume' button instead of a "Modify" button
* Clean up SignatureAlertView to have stuff centered and balanced.
