TODO:
This file is intended to track jobs which have yet to be finished.
This is not official or required in any way.
It's more like quick notes to ourselves and each other.

Chad:
* Forms and Templates save to PendingUploads folder.
* PendingUploads folder is checked for sync.
* Send regular ipa files.
* Export/email/sync/print button(s) on Form Manager.
* Clean up template renaming.
* Clean up section header titles.
* Template Sections need delete function.
* TextFieldAlert should handle rotate and resize.
* Deleting templates should reconsider group names.
* TextFieldAlert should have delegate return key.
* Sanitize template names.
* Fix form meta data
* Generally fix form section displays
* Unpublished templates should have a 'Resume' button instead of a "Modify" button.
* Validate Template before publishing.
* Add autosave for Templates and Forms for crashes/unexpected exits.
* Change hard-coded #defines in TemplateEditor
* Belt icon next to templates (and forms?).
* Add GPS info to signature element.
* Network is avilable?
* Syncing
* Table Element obtain strings from user.

Critical changes:

Important changes:
Inform user when no templates are available for form manager.
1. We need a way to view a completed form
2. When viewing the completed form with signature & GPS coordinate we need to be able to click them to view in google maps

Minor changes:
Create "Checklist" template & form element.
Write form editor finish function, and link to signature element as appropriate.

It-Would-Be-Nice changes:
Email form as pdf (if it's not a ton of work).


Paul:
* Optionally write a TODO list here.

Ron:
* FormElementMultiline:  Validate current length.
* FormElementSingleline: validate current length.
* FormAddressElement:  Validate zip is numerics.
* MainMenu:  The 'slide in/out' effect on rotation looks great, but there are graphical errors when you're moving in from another screen in landscape.  Possible fix:  hide images in viewWillAppear, then animate opacity to fade them in in ViewDidAppear.

Other:
* Localization support
* Change source file creator names (e.g. from Hackenslacker, Programmer, etc)
* Change copyright tags (copyright ThotStudios)
