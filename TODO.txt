TODO:
This file is intended to track jobs which have yet to be finished.
This is not official or required in any way.
It's more like quick notes to ourselves and each other.

Chad:
* Clean up section header titles.
* Deleting templates should reconsider group names.
* Sanitize template names.
* Fix form meta data; Generally fix form section displays
* Unpublished templates should have a 'Resume' button instead of a "Modify" button.
* Validate Template before publishing.
* Add autosave for Templates and Forms for crashes/unexpected exits.
* Change hard-coded #defines in TemplateEditor
* Belt icon next to templates (and forms?).
* Network is available?
* Syncing
* Some part of the signature view is numb to tap downs, but still draws.
* Check Form Finish method for completeness.
* Adding an element should auto-edit that element.
* Add Multi-line default length requirements.
* Clean up template renaming (currently, templates are named, but file is not).
* Form Manager, filter by template get the wrong template?

Critical changes:
1) Viewing/Editing a form causes a crash.
2) GPS accuracy isn't shown to user.
3) No image for Abort Form button on Form Editor page.
4) No image for Cancel button on Profile page.
5) Address Element is misaligned and State Abbr is occluded.


Important changes:
Inform user when no templates are available for form manager.
2. When viewing the completed form with signature & GPS coordinate we need to be able to click them to view in google maps

Minor changes:
Create "Checklist" template & form element.
Write form editor finish function, and link to signature element as appropriate.

It-Would-Be-Nice changes:
Email form as pdf (if it's not a ton of work).

Paul:
* Optionally write a TODO list here.

Ron:
* FormElementMultiline:  Validate current length.
* FormElementSingleline: validate current length.
* FormAddressElement:  Validate zip is numerics.
* MainMenu:  The 'slide in/out' effect on rotation looks great, but there are graphical errors when you're moving in from another screen in landscape.  Possible fix:  hide images in viewWillAppear, then animate opacity to fade them in in ViewDidAppear.

Other:
* Localization support
* Change source file creator names (e.g. from Hackenslacker, Programmer, etc)
* Change copyright tags (copyright ThotStudios)
