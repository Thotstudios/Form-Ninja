TODO:
This file is intended to track jobs which have yet to be finished.
This is not official or required in any way.
It's more like quick notes to ourselves and each other.

Chad:
* Clean up section header titles.
* Sanitize template names.
* Fix form meta data; Generally fix form section displays
* Validate Template before publishing.
* Add autosave for Templates and Forms for crashes/unexpected exits.
* Change hard-coded #defines in TemplateEditor
* Belt icon next to templates (and forms?).
* Network is available?
* Syncing
* Some part of the signature view is numb to tap downs, but still draws.
* Check Form Finish method for completeness.
* Adding an element should auto-edit that element.
* Add Multi-line default length requirements.
* Clean up template renaming (currently, templates are named, but file is not).
* forms -> delete all forms -> main menu -> templates -> delete all templates -> menu -> forms -> crash
* New template with geosignature, publish, save -> new form with that template, back, new form again -> crash
* graphics in landscape

Critical changes:

Important changes:
Inform user when no templates are available for form manager.
2. When viewing the completed form with signature & GPS coordinate we need to be able to click them to view in google maps

Minor changes:
Create "Checklist" template & form element.
Create phone number and name and email address elements
Create a better way to choose an element: e.g. a table of *kinds* of elements which give another table of actual elements.
Write form editor finish function, and link to signature element as appropriate.

It-Would-Be-Nice changes:
Email form as pdf (if it's not a ton of work).

Paul:
* Optionally write a TODO list here.

Ron:

* FormElementSingleline: validate current length.
* FormAddressElement:  Validate zip is numerics.
