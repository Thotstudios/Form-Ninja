Form-Ninja is a tablet app for designing, distributing, and filing forms in a paperless setting. Our website parallel allows for more advanced features including managing groups of users and groups of forms.

The primary purpose of the app is to replace or subsidize existing form management systems in any office size, with a focus on smaller companies which encounter upfront costs to develop and maintain files. This cost is what our app targets, in an effort to reduce expenses for start-up companies.
