paste into code where you want to alert to pop up (eg in a button's trigger function)

[[[[SignatureAlertView alloc] initWithDelegate:self onSuccess:@selector(succes:) onFailure:@selector(failureMethod)] autorelease] show];

also define these methods (which can be renamed, if they're renamed in the above line):

-(void) failure
{
}
-(void) success:(UIImage*)signatureImage
{
}
